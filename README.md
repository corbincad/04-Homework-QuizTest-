# 04-Homework-QuizTest-

This homework gave me alot of trouble. With some further practice after the deadline, I've managed to come up with an almost working assignment. Timer is broken and it's not pretty to look at. 

I've commented out several lines of code in my HTML. It was a before and after attempt and what's commented out was previously attempted code that I couldn't get to work.
